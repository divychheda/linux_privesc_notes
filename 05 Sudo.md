## Shell Escaping
- `sudo -l` to see what commands you can run without password as root.
- search for those commands in https://gtfobins.github.io/ and look under `sudo` subheading
- eg, for vim: sudo vim -c ':!/bin/sh'

## Intended functionality
- Sometimes if cant find on gtfobins then google for intended functionality
- eg, for apache2 there is no way to get shell but to view restricted files like /etc/shadow

## LD_PRELOAD
- Follow the steps here : https://www.hackingarticles.in/linux-privilege-escalation-using-ld_preload/
